        <h1>My favorite hobby <br><span id="name>">Arts and Crafts</span></h1>

        <p> My hobby is doing art. Arts is my favorite activity. When I get some free time after my studies,I sit down and do my art work. Art is an activity which requires creative thinking. After doing art studying is much easier because I am clear minded and relaxed so I can better grab the concepts better. I also become delighted by doing art because I donâ€™t waste my
            mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some relaxing activity. Every evening, I have two or three hours free. Mostly, I do art at that time. I love doing art!</p>
